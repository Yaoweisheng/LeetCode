#### [184. 部门工资最高的员工](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/department-highest-salary/)

> 解题思路

group by分组查询到每个部门的最大工资作为临时表存储起来，员工表、部门表和最大工资临时表使用from关联起来，多条件where语句查询到答案

join on关联多表

使用join on将员工表和部门表关联起来，where in关联员工表和最大工资临时表

> 代码

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
--from语句关联多表
select Department.Name as Department, Employee.Name as Employee, Employee.Salary
from Employee, (
    select max(Salary) as max_salary, DepartmentId
    from Employee
    group by DepartmentId
) as Employee2, Department
where Employee.DepartmentId = Employee2.DepartmentId and Employee.Salary = Employee2.max_salary and Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id

--join on关联多表
select Department.Name as Department, Employee.Name as Employee, Employee.Salary
from
Employee
join Department
on Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
join (
    select DepartmentId, max(Salary) as Salary
    from Employee
    group by DepartmentId
)as Employee2
on Employee.DepartmentId = Employee2.DepartmentId and Employee.Salary = Employee2.Salary

--join on关联员工表、部门表，where in关联员工表和最大工资临时表
select Department.Name as Department, Employee.Name as Employee, Employee.Salary
from
Employee
join Department
on Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
where (Employee.DepartmentId, Salary) in (
    select DepartmentId, max(Salary)
    from Employee
    group by DepartmentId
)
```
